# Application for cultural center management

## Brief description

It is the backend part of an application that supports the management of cultural centres. 

The programme provides users with many functions, for example:
* sending messages to the institution,
* signing up for events and rating them,
* taking part in competitions and voting,
* writing articles,
* applying for jobs.

Confirmation of the event registration is sent by email to the user.

Users with the administrator role can additionally manage the content of all tabs and manage the visibility of work submitted by users.

The application was built according to the REST architectural style. Authentication and authorisation is carried out using JWT.
All files uploaded by users are stored in dropbox
